jquery中prop和attr的区别
 
 //官方文档
 jQuery 1.6 introduced the .prop() method for setting or getting properties on nodes and deprecated the use of .attr() to set properties. However, versions up to 1.9 continued to support using .attr() for specific situations. This behavior in the name of backwards compatibility causes confusion when selectors are used that distinguish between attributes and properties.
For example, boolean attributes such as checked and disabled on a checkbox are affected by this change. The correct behavior of "input[checked]" is to select checkboxes that have a checked attribute, regardless of its string value, and regardless of their current state. In contrast, "input:checked" selects checkboxes that are currently checked as reflected in their boolean (true or false) checked property, which is affected when the user clicks the box for example. Versions prior to 1.9 sometimes do not select the correct nodes with these selectors.
jQuery 1.6 开始引入了prop()去设置和获取properties   弃用了attr()设置properties
input[checkbox],input[radio]的checked，disabled等返回布尔值属性用prop属性获取或设置  用attr()失效

Here are some examples of correct usage when setting checked on a checkbox; the same rules apply for disabled. Note that only the property consistently reflects and updates the current state of the checkbox across all browsers; rarely will you need to set the attribute.

例子
// Correct if changing the attribute is desired
$(elem).attr("checked", "checked");
// Correct for checking the checkbox
$(elem).prop("checked", true);
 
// Correct if removing the attribute is desired (rare)
$(elem).removeAttr("checked");
// Correct for clearing the checkbox
$(elem).prop("checked", false);
